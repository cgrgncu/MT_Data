Electrode Model PE4


Height :
20 cm


Height :
20 cm


Weight :
1.5 kg


Dimensions :
20 cm x 10 cm


Flat response across Frequency range :
DC to 10 000 Hz


A low noise, low offset, low DC drift, non-polarizing, broadband electrode. Porous ceramic contact surface and PbCl2 slurry prevent polarization. Heavy-duty PVC construction protects against foul weather and temperature variations when buried in the earth.
